### Summary
The final project in the MAE 3270: Mechanics of Materials course was to identify a wrench design and material that could meet a series of safety factor constraints, including yield strength, fracture toughness, and cyclic loading. After chosing a design, students had to CAD the model and test its performance in ANSYS Static Structural. Comparing FEA results to simplified hand-calculations, students got a better understanding of where the assumptions made in simplified equations were valid or not.


### Identifying Design Range
Safety factor 
- $$X_0$$ = 4 for yield or brittle failure, depending on the material.
- $$X_K$$ = 2 for crack growth with an assumed 0.04 in crach length.
- $$X_S$$ = 1.5 for fatigue stress at 1,000,000 cycles.
