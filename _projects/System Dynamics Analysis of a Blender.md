### Summary

The final project in the MAE 3260: System Dynamics course was to analyze how a device works in a system dynamics lens. My group analyzed the control system of cheap versus expensive blenders.

This paper is my group's submission comparing the system dynamics performance of a cheap versus an expensive blender. I specifically focused on the cheap blender aspect looking at how its internals worked. This helped to develop an idea of how its different modes were achieved and ultimately making a block diagram for the system.
