Hi! I’m Max.

I am and always have been curious about how the world worked and will work in the future. This curiosity has driven me to develop a broad set of interests and is why I study engineering.

I am particularly interested in multidisciplinary problem solving. I find problems that involve bringing together different areas and information particularly interesting.
I have found sustainability problems to be a particularly interesting design space for bringing together multiple disciplines and the opportunities to use knowledge from the past on modern problems. This interest led me to help found CSalt and serve as its president for the past two years. In that role I have facilitated our different subteams working together and combining their distinct work and have tried to bring in creative and unique solutions to the rapidly developing field of wave energy.
