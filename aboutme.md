Heyo! I’m Kasper.

I’m a learner. Every time I approach an obstacle, something I don’t quite understand, it excites me. I become motivated by the pursuit of the unknown. Because it’s difficult, and I find the struggle rewarding.

That’s why I am an engineer. It’s also why I’m particularly interested in aerospace. I search for boundaries to break and new ideas to form. I hope to be on the cutting edge of the unknown.

At Cornell’s Design Build Fly, I’ve had three years of experience as a member, subteam lead, and now full-lead, working through every part of the design cycle. From the time rules come out in August, to our compeition in April, I am non-stop at work: ideating, redesigning, improvising. Everything always breaks the first time around. Then the second. Then, if you’re unlucky, the third. But I couldn’t imagine anything different. Never do I learn so much in such a short time, and never is it as rewarding.
